      <p>Hello! My name is Michelle.</p>
      <p>I'm creating this personal website to learn more about web development.</p>
      <p>Fun fact: My original goal for this project was just to learn how to deploy a site using GitHub Pages.</p>
      <p>However, I've learned a lot more since then!</p>
